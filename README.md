## about

red ball maker plus is an advanced tool for creating custom levels in red ball. to play these levels, run the `rbmaker_player.swf` file in a flash player (both are included in the releases).

this project is inspired by smartcube's red ball maker mod for red ball, who also made the swf required to play the levels.

this is currently a work in progress, and there are many more features to come (see the suggestions section below)

this project's development relies heavily on user suggestions, which can be made either by asking in the [red ball maker plus thread](https://discord.com/channels/669649577846243328/1205703739550203924) in the [red ball speedrunning discord](https://discord.gg/NtectkbxPK), or by creating an issue in the issues tab in this repository.

before making a suggestion, make sure it isn't in this list, which includes everything i have planned:
- creating joints between blocks
- script editing, as well as an alternate language for scripting
- built in player, along with movement tracing
- toolbox for saving and duplicating blocks
- ui color themes
